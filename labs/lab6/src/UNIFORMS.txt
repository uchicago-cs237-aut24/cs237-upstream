There are three uniform values that are used by the shaders:

  [PC]  the per-mesh model transform + mesh color, which are
        represented as push constants
  [UBO] the uniform buffer that holds the per-frame transforms
  [CMAP] the per-mesh color-map sampler
  [SMAP] the depth-buffer sampler

The first of these is defined per-object, while the third is per-frame.

		PC      UBO	CMAP	SMAP
depth.vert:	x        x
depth.frag:
dir-light.vert	x        x
dir-light.frag	x        x	 x	 x

We use two descriptor sets: Set 0 is the UBO+CMAP and Set 1 is the DMAP.
